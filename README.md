# BourneLoader
Cool Interface Loader like something off of Bourne Identity's Spy UIs

Draft:

loader = new BourneLoader();

//messages and speed

loader.preloadMsgs(["loading this", "loading that", "something else"], 2);

loader.postLoadMsgs({"top":["Title of that user is looking at", "Simple instuction"], "bottom":["Some info about what user is looking at", "Some other info that comes after that", "the final message that sticks"], "speed":2});


// all fonts are in the CSS

These are just notes and will disappear in a few hours when I implement, but for now going to movies with wife and then will finish this tonight.
